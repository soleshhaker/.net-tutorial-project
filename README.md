# .net tutorial project
Project used as my first introduction into .net framework
I did it with the course "Introduction to ASP.NET Core MVC" by Bhrugen Patel. After finishing it, I added something from myself.
Such as:
- DTOs
- AutoMapper
- Caching using Redis
- Unit and integration tests
- Bogus and Fluent Assertions
- Logging using Serilog
- Try catch where its needed for controllers
- Prometheus, OpenTelemetry for monitoring and tracking
- Sending logs to logstash instance
- Propably more that I do not remember
